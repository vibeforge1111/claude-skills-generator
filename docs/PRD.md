## Project Name

**Claude Skills Generator**

## One-liner

A CLI tool that creates deeply capable, well-trained Claude Code agents with AI-assisted writing, validation, testing, and MCP integration.

---

## Problem Statement

Creating high-quality Claude Code skills is currently:

1. **Manual and error-prone** - No templates, no validation, easy to miss required sections
2. **Inconsistent** - Different repos use different formats, no standard structure
3. **Shallow** - Skills are often just static instructions without rich training data
4. **Disconnected** - MCP server requirements are documented inconsistently or not at all
5. **Untested** - No way to verify a skill works before deploying it

---

## Target User

Developers using Claude Max in terminal who want to rapidly create, validate, and enhance Claude skills for personal or team use.

---

## Core Features (V1)

### 1. AI-Assisted Skill Creation
```
skill new [name]
```
- Interactive wizard with Claude helping write the skill
- Context-aware defaults (detects project type, pre-fills template)
- Multiple templates: basic, debugging, document processing, API integration

### 2. Skill Editing
```
skill edit <name>
```
- Edit skill files with live preview
- Syntax highlighting for YAML frontmatter + Markdown

### 3. Multi-Layer Validation
```
skill validate <name>
```
- **Layer 1:** Schema validation (required fields, structure)
- **Layer 2:** Quality scoring (completeness, clarity, examples, error handling)
- **Layer 3:** AI review (Claude analyzes and critiques the skill)
- **Layer 4:** Token count and progressive disclosure check

### 4. Skill Playground
```
skill test <name>
```
- Run skill against sample prompts in sandbox
- Shows how Claude interprets and uses the skill
- Outputs improvement suggestions after test

### 5. Auto-Improvement Suggestions
```
skill improve <name>
```
- AI reviews skill and suggests specific edits
- Identifies gaps: missing error handling, unclear instructions, etc.
- Can auto-apply suggestions with confirmation

### 6. Context-Aware Suggestions
```
skill suggest
```
- Scans current project structure
- Recommends skills to create based on tech stack, patterns, needs
- Links to relevant templates or community skills

### 7. YouTube Training Integration
```
skill train <name> --youtube <url>
```
- Extracts transcript from YouTube videos
- Enriches skill knowledge base with video content
- Supports multiple URLs for comprehensive training

### 8. MCP Server Integration
```
skill mcps <name>
```
- Shows required MCP servers for a skill
- Generates MCP config snippets
- Documents installation instructions

### 9. Skill Management
```
skill list                  # Show installed skills
skill import <url>          # Import from GitHub
skill export <name>         # Package for sharing
```

---

## Out of Scope (V1)

- **Skill composition/chaining** - Combining multiple skills into workflows (V2)
- **Community registry hosting** - Centralized skill marketplace (V2)
- **Skill analytics** - Usage tracking and success rates (V2)
- **Skill versioning** - Git-like version control for skills (V2)
- **GUI/Web interface** - V1 is CLI-only

---

## Skill Output Format

Following the community standard (VibeShip + Anthropic patterns):

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions
├── scripts/              # Optional helper scripts
├── resources/            # Training sources, references
│   ├── transcripts/      # YouTube transcripts
│   └── examples/         # Code examples
└── mcp-config.json       # MCP server requirements
```

### SKILL.md Structure

```yaml

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Runtime | Node.js | Cross-platform, good CLI ecosystem |
| CLI Framework | Commander.js or Yargs | Mature, well-documented |
| AI Integration | Claude API (Anthropic SDK) | Direct integration with Claude |
| YouTube | youtube-transcript API | Extract transcripts without auth |
| File System | Node fs + glob | Standard file operations |
| Validation | Ajv (JSON Schema) | Fast schema validation |
| Markdown | marked + front-matter | Parse SKILL.md files |
| UI (terminal) | Inquirer.js + chalk | Interactive prompts, colors |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| YouTube API changes/blocks | Use multiple transcript extraction methods, cache results |
| Claude API costs | Cache AI responses, batch operations, allow offline mode |
| Skill format fragmentation | Validate against multiple formats, normalize on save |
| Large transcripts exceed context | Chunk and summarize, use progressive loading |

---

- Community registry (search/browse/publish)
- Skill versioning and diffing
- Full MCP auto-installation

### V3: Advanced Features
- Video analysis (not just transcripts)
- Skill analytics and success tracking
- Team collaboration features
- Web UI companion
